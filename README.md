# PRODUCT AMANGEMENT AND AGENTIC AI BY IITPatna

## 03/05 Session -1

### What a Product manager actually does?

- Bridge between User, technology and Business
- Defines Produce Visison and stratergy aloigend with business goals and user needs
- Manages product roadmap - balancing stakeholders inputs
- Leads cross-functional teams
- Advocates for customer, ensuring product solves the problems

### Product Thinking:

- Focus on the problem and not the solution - why customer need this feature, what probelm does this solves
- Start with the WHY - user centric mindset. Think in terms of outcomes and user values and not just deleivering features.
- Understand user needs, pain points and jobs-to-be-done
- Define value proposition before building the product not after building the product

## How do user identify the product, how user learn to use it.

- CYCLE: launchin -> learning -> validating
- Need - Data and Evidence
- No.1 reason for startup failure - customer dont need it Value Propsition:

## How your product or service creates value for the customer

Tools: Value proposition canva - ensure fit between customer's profile and product offering
Solve this problem - for this user - by doing this

The Value Proposition Canvas is a strategic tool used to ensure a product or service
is aligned with what customers truly want.  
It has two key parts: 1. Customer Profile – outlines customer jobs, pains, and gains. 2. Value Map – shows your product’s pain relievers, gain creators, and products/services.  
The goal is to create a clear fit between what the customer needs and what your product offers.

Usecase: Uber eats Problem-Solution Fit:

- Ensure product is addressing real and clearly defined user problem or need
- Validate propsed solution solves the targeted problem effectively
- Ensure suffient user intrest in the solution
- Iterate these steps to improve to refine the problem and thus the solution (pain-relievers)
  This is an importan precursor to pursuing product-market fit

### NOTES:

A **Product Manager** owns the what and why of a product, defining its vision, user needs, roadmap and success metrics.
Meanwhile, a Project Manager owns the how and when, handling planning, scheduling, resource coordination and delivery
to ensure the work gets done on time, on budget, and within scope of the project.

A **Product Owner** is an Agile‐team role focused on tactical execution—owning the backlog,
refining user stories, and working day-to-day with developers to ensure the team builds the right features.
A Product Manager, by contrast, owns the strategic end-to-end vision—defining market opportunities, setting the roadmap,
aligning business goals, and measuring outcomes. They overlap on prioritization and stakeholder liaison,
but the PM’s remit is broader (vision, business case, metrics) while the PO’s is narrower (backlog management, sprint planning)

A PM finds the real problem through user interviews, data analysis and stakeholder discussions to write a clear problem statement.
Then they brainstorm and prototype solutions, run quick tests, prioritize the best approach, and lead the team to build,
launch and measure success

**Customer jobs** refer to the tasks or problems that a customer is trying to accomplish or solve in their life.
These can be functional (e.g., "I need to organize my schedule") or emotional (e.g., "I want to feel confident in my decisions").
Understanding customer jobs helps you design products or services that address those specific needs.

- **POC or MVP ? Which comes first ? Product Solution FIt means what POC or MVP?**
  - POC (Proof of Concept) comes first. It tests if your idea is technically possible.
  - MVP (Minimum Viable Product) comes after, it tests if users actually want it.

Product-Solution Fit usually happens at the MVP stage, when you've built something basic and see if it solves a real user problem.

**The Samosa Story: How a Snack Becomes a Hit Meet the team behind the samosa:**
Product Manager (PM): The team captain who dreams up what kind of samosa people will love.
They decide the big idea, like making a crunchy, tasty samosa with new flavors.

Product Owner (PO): The coach who breaks the big idea into smaller steps.
They make sure the team focuses on the most important tasks first, like perfecting the potato filling before trying cheese.

Product Developer: The chef who experiments with recipes, cooks, tastes, and improves samosas until they’re delicious.

Project Manager: The organizer who keeps everything on schedule. They make sure tasks get done, ingredients arrive, and
samosas reach the shops on time.

How it works:  
 The PM says, “Let’s create a new crunchy samosa everyone will love.”
The PO says, “First, perfect the potato filling, then try cheese.”  
 The Developer cooks and tests the samosas.  
 The Project Manager ensures the team has what they need & the samosas get delievered

### Job of the Product Manager:

Desirability - Do people want this?
Desirability signs - Rapid user adoption
High Engagement Metrices -> daily active, time spent in app
Social sharing

Feasibilty - Can we build this?
Includes technolgy, fetures, engineering talent anf ability to scale infrastructure as user grew

Viability - Can this be sustainable business?
Viability is proven by apps freemium model ( providing premium for free for some period)

### SkillSet VS MindSet

### What PM should take care of:

1. **Customer obsession over Stakeholder management** - Eg. Netflix from DVD-selling in mails to streaming lakhs of content

2. **Bias for Action over Analysis Paralysis** - Eg: Insta launching stories option in 8 months to cunter snapchat

3. **First Princples Thinking over Best Practices copying** - solving probles by starting with most basic, prven facts and building up from there,
   rather than following what everyone else does.
   Best practice -> follow what all do
   Eg: Elon Musk's SpaceX 90% reduced price in rocket launch price by manufacturingusing in-house components and create reusable rockets

4. **Systems Thinking over shotterm execution** - Eg: Airbnb create trust between complete strangers by user govt. ID verification,
   reviews from both customer and owners and other safty guidelines so they would feel comfortable

5. **Adaptable and Ownership over TaskExecution** - When plan fails, own the outcome and adapt

### Tech to PM Mindset transition:

### NOTES:

Feasibility is about can we build it - do we have the tech, team, and tools?
Viability is about should we build it - will it make money or support the business long term?

In today’s trend, a product should aim to create real user impact - by solving meaningful problems, driving adoption, improving retention, and delivering measurable value.
That could mean saving users time, making something easier or more accessible, or unlocking a new habit or behavior.
The impact should be visible in both user satisfaction and business outcomes like growth, engagement, or revenue.

#### what is user aquisition cost vs lifetime value?

User acquisition cost (CAC) is how much you spend to get one new customer—like ad spend, marketing, and sales costs.

Lifetime value (LTV) is how much revenue you earn from that customer over their entire relationship with your product.
Ideally, LTV should be much higher than CAC to make the business sustainable.
